# Time Value Of Money
* The time value of money (TVM) is a fundamental concept in finance that expresses the idea that money today is worth more than the same amount of money in the future. The reason for this is that money today can be invested and earn interest, whereas money received in the future cannot.

* The most basic application of TVM is in the computation of the present value (PV) and future value (FV) of a sum of money.
