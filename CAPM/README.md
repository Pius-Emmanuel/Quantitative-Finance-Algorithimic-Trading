# CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL (CAPM)

* The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a widely used model in finance for estimating the expected return on an investment. It describes the relationship between the expected return on an asset and the risk-free rate, the market return, and the asset's beta (systematic risk).

* The CAPM equation is:
* Expected return = Risk-free rate + Beta (Market return - Risk-free rate)

* The risk-free rate is the return on a risk-free investment, such as a government bond. 
* The market return is the return on a broad market index, such as the S&P 500. 
* Beta is a measure of the volatility of an asset compared to the market as a whole. 
* A beta of 1 indicates that the asset's price will move with the market, while a beta less than 1 means it is less volatile than the market, and a beta greater than 1 means it is more volatile.
