# Bonds Pricing
* The most common method used to price bonds is the discounted cash flow model, also known as the "bond pricing formula". The bond pricing formula takes into account the bond's face value, coupon rate (the interest rate that the bond pays), and time to maturity (the number of years until the bond matures). The bond pricing formula is as follows:

* Bond Price = (C / (r - g)) * (1 - (1 + g)^(-n)) + (F / (1 + r)^n)

* Where:
C = Annual coupon payment
r = Required rate of return or yield to maturity (YTM)
g = Rate of growth of dividends or cash flows
F = Face value or principal
n = Number of years to maturity

* The bond pricing formula considers the coupon payments and principal return as future cash flows, and discounts them back to the present using the required rate of return. This gives an estimate of the bond's current value.
