# WIENER PROCESS (BROWNIAN MOTION)

* A Wiener process, also known as a Brownian motion, is a mathematical model for a type of random process that describes the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid. It is named after the mathematician Norbert Wiener.

* In mathematical finance, a Wiener process is often used to model the random evolution of stock prices over time. Under this model, the stock price follows a random walk, and the change in the stock price at any given time is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and a fixed variance. The stock price at any time t is given by the sum of all the previous changes.

* The Wiener process has several important properties, including:

1. It is a continuous-time process with no discontinuities.
2. It has independent and normally distributed increments.
3. It has a constant mean and a constant variance.
4. It is a Markov process, which means that the future behavior of the process depends only on the current state and not on the past.

* The Wiener process is widely used in mathematical finance as a model for stock prices and other financial quantities because it is simple to work with mathematically and it captures the essential feature of randomness in financial markets. However, it also has some limitations as it doesn't account for the existence of jumps and barriers in some financial assets, volatility clustering and mean reversion.
