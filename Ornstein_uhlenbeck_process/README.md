# Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a mathematical model used to describe the random motion of a particle undergoing Brownian motion (i.e. random motion due to collisions with other particles) in a fluid or gas. It is also used to describe the motion of a particle in a potential field with a restoring force. The process is named after Leonard Ornstein and George Uhlenbeck, who first proposed the model in 1930. It is a type of Markov process, which means that the future state of the system depends only on the current state and not on the history of the system. The process is defined by a stochastic differential equation, which describes the evolution of the position of the particle over time.
